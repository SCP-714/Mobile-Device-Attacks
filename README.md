## Which of the following mobile security concerns is characterized by malicious code that specifically targets mobile devices?


Malicious websites <-

Unsecure applications

Phishing attacks

Lost and stolen devices


    
  - Malicious or compromised websites are often used to launch web or network attacks. An attacker can design a website to easily determine what type of device is being used and then use malicious code that specifically targets mobile devices.

Phishing and other social engineering attacks are often more productive on mobile device users, but are not characterized by malicious code that specifically targets mobile devices.

Data loss can occur when a mobile device is lost or stolen, but is not characterized by malicious code that specifically targets mobile devices.

Unsecure applications are a security concern since mobile apps may not have the same security protections as a browser, but they are not characterized by malicious code that specifically targets mobile devices.


## Which key area in the mobile device security model is supported by device designers requiring passwords, biometrics, and two-factor authentication methods?


Isolation

Access controls <-

Encryption

Digital signing

  - Access control includes passwords, biometrics, and two-factor authentication methods to gain access to the device.

Only digitally signed apps should be installed. A digital signature verifies that an app hasn't been tampered with and verifies that the app came from the original author.

Encryption can be used to secure communications to and from a mobile device and to securely store information on a mobile device.

Isolation refers to a mobile device's application sandbox that forces applications to run as a separate process.


## Which of the following describes the risks of spyware that are particular to mobile devices?

Spyware can exploit applications that have not been patched.

Spyware can monitor and log call histories, GPS locations, and text messages. <-

Spyware can crack weak passwords.

Spyware can root or jailbreak a mobile device.
